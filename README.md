# Online Gaming Platform Architecture Blueprint

This repository captures the high-level architecture, module boundaries, and example implementation details for a modular online gaming platform. The platform enables Telegram-based onboarding, secure wallet management, integrations with payment gateways and game providers, and rich reporting & administration capabilities.

## Contents
- `docs/architecture.md` – System overview, technology stack, integrations, and roadmap.
- `docs/module-structure.md` – Proposed monorepo structure covering apps, services, shared libraries, and infrastructure assets.
- `backend/apps/api/src/modules/wallet` – Reference NestJS wallet module demonstrating service, controller, DTO, and event patterns.

## Key Requirements (Summary)
- Two-factor authentication using Telegram login + email confirmation.
- Wallet with multi-balance support (cash, bonus, locked) and transactional history.
- Game provider integrations via adapter layer for launching sessions and processing bets.
- Payment gateway integration with webhook processing, KYC-aware withdrawal limits, and AML rules.
- Report builder powered by ClickHouse analytics and customizable exports.
- Administrative console for user management, provider configuration, and monitoring.

## Development Approach
1. **Phase 1 (1–2 months)**: Core authentication, wallet ledger, initial provider + payment integration.
2. **Phase 2 (2–3 months)**: Reporting pipeline, ClickHouse ETL, administrator tooling.
3. **Phase 3 (4–6 months)**: Infrastructure hardening, observability, anti-fraud enhancements, multi-provider scaling.

The blueprint prioritizes domain-driven boundaries, event-driven communication (Kafka/NATS), and observability with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus. It can be used as a starting point for implementation within a multi-service TypeScript monorepo.
